RandomMatrixStability
================================================================================

**This R package complements the publication "Component response rate variation underlies the stability of highly complex finite systems" (Duthie 2020). It contains all of the manuscript text and supplemental information, and all code for recreating analyses. The [website](https://bradduthie.github.io/RandomMatrixStability/) includes [documentation](https://bradduthie.github.io/RandomMatrixStability/reference/index.html) for all functions in the package. This project was funded by [The Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/).**
