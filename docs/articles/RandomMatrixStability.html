<a href="#abstract" class="anchor"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>The stability of a complex system generally decreases with increasing system size and interconnectivity, a counterintuitive result of widespread importance across the physical, life, and social sciences. Despite recent interest in the relationship between system properties and stability, the effect of variation in response rate across system components remains unconsidered. Here I vary the component response rates (<span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span>) of randomly generated complex systems. I use numerical simulations to show that when component response rates vary, the potential for system stability increases. These results are robust to common network structures, including small-world and scale-free networks, and cascade food webs. Variation in <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> is especially important for stability in highly complex systems, in which the probability of stability would otherwise be negligible. At such extremes of simulated system complexity, the largest stable complex systems would be unstable if not for variation in <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span>. My results therefore reveal a previously unconsidered aspect of system stability that is likely to be pervasive across all realistic complex systems.</p>

<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>In 1972, May<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a></sup></span> first demonstrated that randomly assembled systems of sufficient complexity are almost inevitably unstable given infinitesimally small perturbations. Complexity in this case is defined by the size of the system (i.e., the number of potentially interacting components; <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>), its connectance (i.e., the probability that one component will interact with another; <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>), and the variance of interaction strengths (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}\)</span>)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>. May’s finding that the probability of local stability falls to near zero given a sufficiently high threshold of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\sqrt{SC}\)</span> is broadly relevant for understanding the dynamics and persistence of systems such as ecological<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>–<a href="#ref-Grilli2017">6</a></sup></span>, neurological<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Gray2008">7</a>,<a href="#ref-Gray2009">8</a></sup></span>, biochemical<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Rosenfeld2009">9</a>,<a href="#ref-MacArthur2010">10</a></sup></span>, and socio-economic<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May2008">11</a>–<a href="#ref-Bardoscia2017">14</a></sup></span> networks. As such, identifying general principles that affect stability in complex systems is of wide-ranging importance.</p>
<p>Randomly assembled complex systems can be represented as large square matrices (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span>) with <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> components (e.g., networks of species<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span> or banks<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Haldane2011">12</a></sup></span>). One element of such a matrix, <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span>, defines how component <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> affects component <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the system at a point of equilibrium<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>. Off-diagonal elements (<span class="math inline">\(i \neq j\)</span>) therefore define interactions between components, while diagonal elements (<span class="math inline">\(i = j\)</span>) define component self-regulation (e.g., carrying capacity in ecological communities). Traditionally, off-diagonal elements are assigned non-zero values with a probability <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, which are sampled from a distribution with variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}\)</span>; diagonal elements are set to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2015">5</a></sup></span>. Local system stability is assessed using eigenanalysis on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span>, with the system being stable if the real parts of all eigenvalues (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>), and therefore the leading eigenvalue (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{max}\)</span>), are negative (<span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda_{max}) &lt; 0\)</span>)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>. In a large system (high <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>), eigenvalues are distributed uniformly<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Tao2010">15</a></sup></span> within a circle centred at <span class="math inline">\(\Re = -d\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(-d\)</span> is the mean value of diagonal elements) and <span class="math inline">\(\Im = 0\)</span>, with a radius of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\sqrt{SC}\)</span><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2015">5</a></sup></span> (Fig. 1a). Local stability of randomly assembled systems therefore becomes increasingly unlikely as <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> increase.</p>

In ecological communities, for example, the rate at which population density changes following perturbation will depend on the generation time of organisms, which might vary by orders of magnitude among species. Species with short generation times will respond quickly (high <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>) to perturbations relative to species with long generation times (low <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>). Similarly, the speed at which individual banks respond to perturbations in financial networks, or individuals or institutions respond to perturbations in complex social networks, is likely to vary. The effect of such variance on stability has not been investigated in complex systems theory. Intuitively, variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span>) might be expected to decrease system stability by introducing a new source of variation into the system and thereby increasing <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.

<p><strong>Component response rates of random complex systems</strong>. Complex systems (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span>) are built from two matrices, one modelling component interactions (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>), and second modelling component response rates (<span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span>). Both <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> are square <span class="math inline">\(S \times S\)</span> matrices. Rows in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> define how a given component <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is affected by each component <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in the system, including itself (where <span class="math inline">\(i = j\)</span>). Off-diagonal elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), and diagonal elements are set to <span class="math inline">\(A_{ii} = -1\)</span> as in May<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a></sup></span>. Diagonal elements of <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> are positive, and off-diagonal elements are set to zero (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> is a diagonal matrix with positive support). The distribution of <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> components thereby models the distribution of component response rates. The dynamics of the entire system <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> can be defined as follows<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Patel2018">20</a></sup></span>,</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} \label{defM}
\mathbf{M} = \boldsymbol{\gamma} \mathbf{A}.
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>Equation  thereby serves as a null model to investigate how variation in component response rate (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span>) affects complex systems. In the absence of such variation (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma} = 0\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> is set to the identity matrix (diagonal elements all equal 1) and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{A}\)</span>. Under these conditions, eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> are distributed uniformly<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Tao2010">15</a></sup></span> in a circle centred at <span class="math inline">\((-1, 0)\)</span> with a radius of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \sqrt{SC}\)</span><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a></sup></span> (Fig. 1c).</p>
<p><strong>Effect of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> (co)variation</strong>. The value of <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda_{max})\)</span>, and therefore system stability, can be estimated from five properties of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Tang2014b">21</a></sup></span>. These properties include (1) system size (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>), (2) mean self-regulation of components (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>), (3) mean interaction strength between components (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>), (4) the variance of between component interaction strengths (hereafter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{M}\)</span>, to distinguish from <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span>), and (5) the correlation of interaction strengths between components, <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_{ji}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Sommers1988">22</a></sup></span>. Positive <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> does not change <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, nor does it necessarily change <span class="math inline">\(E[d]\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E[\mu]\)</span>. What <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> does change is the total variation in component interaction strengths (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{M}\)</span>), and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>. Introducing variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> increases the total variation in the system. Variation in the off-diagonal elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> is described by the joint variation of two random variables,</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} \label{var_full}

<p>The increase in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{M}\)</span> caused by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_\gamma\)</span> can be visualised from the eigenvalue spectra of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{M} = \boldsymbol{\gamma}\textbf{A}\)</span> (Fig. 1). Given <span class="math inline">\(d = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C = 1\)</span>, the distribution of eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{M}\)</span> lie within a circle of a radius <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{A}\sqrt{S}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{M}\sqrt{S}\)</span>, respectively (Fig. 1a vs. 1b).

<p><strong>Numerical simulations of random systems with and without <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}}\)</span></strong>. I used numerical simulations and eigenanalysis to test how variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> affects the stability of random matrices with known properties, comparing the stability of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M} = \gamma\mathbf{A}\)</span>. Values of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> were sampled from a uniform distribution where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma} = 1/3\)</span> (see Supplementary Information for other <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> distributions, which gave similar results). In all simulations, diagonal elements were standardised to ensure that <span class="math inline">\(-d\)</span> between individual <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{M}\)</span> pairs were identical (also note that <span class="math inline">\(E[\gamma_{i}] = 1\)</span>). First I focus on the effect of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> across values of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, then for increasing system sizes (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) in random and structured networks. By increasing <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, the objective is to determine the effect of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> as system complexity increases toward the boundary at which stability is realistic for a finite system.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation of random <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> across <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\rho}\)</span></strong>. Numerical simulations revealed that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> results in a nonlinear relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda_{max})\)</span>, which can sometimes increase the stability of the system.

For <span class="math inline">\(-0.4 \leq \rho \leq 0.7\)</span> (shaded region of Fig. 2), expected <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda_{max})\)</span> was lower in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> than <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(\rho \geq -0.1\)</span>, the lower bound of the range of <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda_{max})\)</span> values also decreased given <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span>, resulting in negative <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda_{max})\)</span> values in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\rho = -0.1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0\)</span>. Hence, across a wide range of system correlations, variation in the response rate of system components had a stabilising effect.</p>
<p>The stabilising effect of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> across <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> increased with increasing <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.

<p><strong>Simulation of random <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> across <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span></strong>.

<p>I also simulated 100000 <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> for three types of random networks that are typically interpreted as modelling three types of interspecific ecological interactions<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2011">27</a></sup></span>. These interaction types are competitive, mutualist, and predator-prey, as modelled by off-diagonal elements that are constrained to be negative, positive, or paired such that if <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij} &gt; 0\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(A_{ji} &lt; 0\)</span>, respectively<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span> (but are otherwise identical to the purely random <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>). As <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> increased, a higher number of stable <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> relative to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> was observed for competitor and predator-prey, but not mutualist, systems. A higher number of stable systems was observed whenever <span class="math inline">\(S &gt; 12\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S &gt; 40\)</span> for competitive and predator-prey systems, respectively (note that <span class="math inline">\(\rho &lt; 0\)</span> for predator-prey systems, making stability more likely overall). The stability of mutualist systems was never affected by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The effect of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> on stability did not change qualitatively across values of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{A}\)</span>, or for different distributions of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> (see Supporting Information).</p>
<p><strong>Simulation of structured <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> across <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span></strong>. To investigate how <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> affects the stability of commonly observed network structures, I simulated one million <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M = \gamma A}\)</span> for small-world<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Watts1998">16</a></sup></span>, scale-free<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Albert2002">17</a></sup></span>, and cascade food web<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Solow1998">18</a>,<a href="#ref-Williams2000">19</a></sup></span> networks. In all of these networks, rules determining the presence or absence of an interaction between components <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> constrain the overall structure of the network. In small-world networks, interactions between components are constrained so that the expected degree of separation between any two components increases in proportion to <span class="math inline">\(\log(S)\)</span><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Watts1998">16</a></sup></span>. In scale-free networks, the distribution of the number of components with which a focal component interacts follows a power law; a few components have many interactions while most components have few interactions<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Albert2002">17</a></sup></span>. In cascade food webs, species are ranked and interactions are constrained such that a species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can only feed on <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> if the rank of <span class="math inline">\(i &gt; j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Network structure did not strongly modulate the effect that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> had on stability. For comparable magnitudes of complexity, structured networks still had a higher number of stable <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> than <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>. For random networks, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> increased stability given <span class="math inline">\(S &gt; 10\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{A} = 0.4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C = 1\)</span>), and therefore complexity <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{A} \sqrt{SC} \gtrapprox 1.26\)</span>. This threshold of complexity, above which more <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> than <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> were stable, was comparable for small-world networks, and slightly lower for scale-free networks (note that algorithms for generating small-world and scale-free networks necessarily led to varying <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>; see methods). Varying <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> increased stability in cascade food webs for <span class="math inline">\(S &gt; 27\)</span>, and therefore at a relatively low complexity magnitudes compared to random predator-prey networks (<span class="math inline">\(S &gt; 40\)</span>). Overall, network structure did not greatly change the effect that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> had on increasing the upper bound of complexity within which stability might reasonably be observed.</p>
<p><strong>System feasibility given <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}}\)</span></strong> For complex systems in which individual system components represent the density of some tangible quantity, it is relevant to consider the feasibility of the system. Feasibilility assumes that values of all components are positive at equilibrium<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Grilli2017">6</a>,<a href="#ref-Dougoud2018">28</a>,<a href="#ref-Song2018">29</a></sup></span>. This is of particular interest for ecological communities because population density (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) cannot take negative values, meaning that ecological systems need to be feasible for stability to be biologically realistic<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Dougoud2018">28</a></sup></span>. While my results are intended to be general to all complex systems, and not restricted to species networks, I have also performed a feasibility analysis on all matrices tested for stability. I emphasise that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is not interpreted as population density in this analysis, but instead as a fundamental property of species life history such as expected generation time. Feasibility was unaffected by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> and instead occurred with a fixed probability of <span class="math inline">\(1/2^{S}\)</span>, consistent with a recent proof by Serván et al.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Servan2018">30</a></sup></span> (see Supplementary Information). Hence, for pure interacting species networks, variation in component response rate (i.e., species generation time) does not affect stability at biologically realistic species densities.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted manipulation of <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span></strong>. To further investigate the potential of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> to be stabilising, I used a genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms are heuristic tools that mimic evolution by natural selection, and are useful when the space of potential solutions (in this case, possible combinations of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> values leading to stability in a complex system) is too large to search exhaustively<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Hamblin2013">31</a></sup></span>. Generations of selection on <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> value combinations to minimise <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda_{max})\)</span> demonstrated the potential for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> to increase system stability. Across <span class="math inline">\(S = \{2, 3, ..., 39, 40\}\)</span>, sets of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> values were found that resulted in stable systems with probabilities that were up to four orders of magnitude higher than when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> (see Supplementary Information), meaning that stability could often be achieved by manipulating <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> values rather than <span class="math inline">\(S \times S\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> elements (i.e., by manipulating component response rates rather than interactions between components).</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#discussion" class="anchor"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>I have shown that the stability of complex systems might often be contigent upon variation in the response rates of their individual components, meaning that factors such as rate of trait evolution (in biological networks), transaction speed (in economic networks), or communication speed (in social networks) need to be considered when investigating the stability of complex systems. Variation in component response rate is more likely to be critical for stability in systems that are especially complex, and it can ultimately increase the probability that system stability is observed above that predicted by May’s<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a></sup></span> classically derived <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \sqrt{SC}\)</span> criterion. The logic outlined here is general, and potentially applies to any complex system in which individual system components can vary in their reaction rates to system perturbation.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise that variation in component response rate is not stabilising per se; that is, adding variation in component response rates to a particular system does not increase the probability that the system will be stable. Rather, highly complex systems that are observed to be stable are more likely to have varying component response rates, and for this variation to be critical to their stability (Fig. 4). This is caused by the shift to a non-uniform distribution of eigenvalues that occurs by introducing variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> (Fig. 1), which can sometimes cause all of the real components of the eigenvalues of the system matrix to become negative, but might also increase the real components of eigenvalues.</p>
<p>My focus here is distinct from Gibbs et al.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Gibbs2017">24</a></sup></span>, who applied the same mathematical framework to investigate how a diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> (equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> in my model) affects the stability of a community matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> given an interaction matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> within a generalised Lotka-Volterra model, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{XA}\)</span>. Gibbs et al.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Gibbs2017">24</a></sup></span> analytically demonstrated that the effect of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> on system stability decreases exponentially as system size becomes arbitrarily large (<span class="math inline">\(S \to \infty\)</span>) for a given magnitude of complexity <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\sqrt{SC}\)</span>. My numerical results do not contradict this prediction because I did not scale <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 1 / \sqrt{S}\)</span>, but instead fixed <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and increased <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to thereby increase total system complexity (see Supplemental Information for results simulated across <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>). Overall, I show that component response rate variation increases the upper bound of complexity at which stability can be realistically observed, meaning that highly complex systems are more likely than not to vary in their component response rates, and for this variation to be critical for system stability.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while complex systems were more likely to be stable given variation in component response rate, they were not more likely to be feasible, meaning that stability was not increased when component values were also restricted to being positive at equilibrium. Feasibility is important to consider, particularly for the study of ecological networks of species<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Grilli2017">6</a>,<a href="#ref-Stone2017">25</a>,<a href="#ref-Dougoud2018">28</a>,<a href="#ref-Servan2018">30</a></sup></span> because population densities cannot realistically be negative. My results therefore suggest that variation in the rate of population responses to perturbation (e.g., due to differences in generation time among species) is unlikely to be critical to the stability of purely multi-species interaction networks (see also Supplementary Information). Nevertheless, ecological interactions do not exist in isolation in empirical systems<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Patel2018">20</a></sup></span>, but instead interact with evolutionary, abiotic, or social-economic systems. The relevance of component response rate for complex system stability should therefore not be ignored in the broader context of ecological communities.</p>
<p>The potential importance of component response rate variation was most evident from the results of simulations in which the genetic algorithm was used in attempt to maximise the probability of system stability. The probability that some combination of component response rates could be found to stabilise the system was shown to be up to four orders of magnitude higher than the background probabilities of stability in the absence of any component response rate variation. Instead of manipulating the <span class="math inline">\(S \times S\)</span> interactions between system components, it might therefore be possible to manipulate only the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> response rates of individual system components to achieve stability. Hence, managing the response rates of system components in a targeted way could potentially facilitate the stabilisation of complex systems through a reduction in dimensionality.</p>
<p>A general mathematical framework encompassing shifts in eigenvalue distributions caused by a diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> has been investigated<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Ahmadian2015">23</a></sup></span> and recently applied to questions concerning species density and feasibility<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Gibbs2017">24</a>,<a href="#ref-Stone2017">25</a></sup></span>, but <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> has not been interpreted as rates of response of individual system components to perturbation. My model focuses on component response rates for systems of a finite size, in which complexity is high but not yet high enough to make the probability of stability unrealistically low for actual empirical systems. For this upper range of system size, randomly assembled complex systems are more likely to be stable if their component response rates vary (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(10 &lt; S &lt; 30\)</span> for parameter values in Fig. 4). Variation in component response rate might therefore be critical for maintaining stability in many highly complex empirical systems. These results are broadly applicable for understanding the stability of complex networks across the physical, life, and social sciences.</p>

<p><strong>Component response rate (<span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span>) variation</strong>. In a synthesis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on community stability, Patel et al. model a system that includes a vector of potentially changing species densities (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{n}\)</span>) and a vector of potentially evolving traits (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Patel2018">20</a></sup></span>. For any species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> or trait <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, change in species density (<span class="math inline">\(n_{i}\)</span>) or trait value (<span class="math inline">\(x_{j}\)</span>) with time (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) is a function of the vectors <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{n}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dn_{i}}{dt} = n_{i}f_{i}(\mathbf{n}, \mathbf{x}),\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dx_{j}}{dt} = \epsilon g_{j}(\mathbf{n}, \mathbf{x}).\]</span></p>
<p>In the above, <span class="math inline">\(f_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_{j}\)</span> are functions that define the effects of all species densities and trait values on the density of a species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and the value of trait <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, respectively. Patel et al. were interested in stability when the evolution of traits was relatively slow or fast in comparison with the change in species densities<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Patel2018">20</a></sup></span>, and this is modulated in the above by the scalar <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. The value of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> thereby determines the timescale separation between ecology and evolution, with high <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> modelling relatively fast evolution and low <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> modelling relative slow evolution<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Patel2018">20</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>I use the same principle that Patel et al. use to modulate the relative rate of evolution to modulate rates of component responses for <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> components. Following May<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-May1973">32</a></sup></span>, the value of a component <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(v_{i}(t)\)</span>) is affected by the value of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(v_{j}(t)\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s marginal effect on <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span>), and by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s response rate (<span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span>),</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dv_{i}(t)}{dt} = \gamma_{i} \sum_{j=1}^{S}a_{ij}v_{j}(t).\]</span></p>
<p>In matrix notation<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1973">32</a></sup></span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d\mathbf{v}(t)}{dt} = \boldsymbol{\gamma} \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}(t).\]</span></p>
<p>In the above, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> is a diagonal matrix in which elements correspond to individual component response rates. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M} = \boldsymbol{\gamma} \mathbf{A}\)</span> defines the change in values of system components and can be analysed using the techniques of May<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Ahmadian2015">23</a>,<a href="#ref-May1973">32</a></sup></span>. In these analyses, row means of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> are expected to be identical, but variation around this expectation will naturally arise due to random sampling of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> off-diagonal elements and finite <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. In simulations, the total variation in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> row means that is attributable to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is small relative to that attributable to <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span>, especially at high <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Variation in <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> specifically isolates the effects of differing component response rates, hence causing differences in expected <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> row means.</p>
<p><strong>Construction of random and structured networks</strong>. I used the R programming language for all numerical simulations and analyses<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Rproject">33</a></sup></span>. Purely random networks were generated by sampling off-diagonal elements from an i.i.d <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.4^{2})\)</span> with a probability <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> (unsampled elements were set to zero). Diagonal elements <span class="math inline">\(A_{ii}\)</span> were set to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. Elements of <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> were simulated i.i.d. from a distribution with positive support (typically <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 2)\)</span>). Random <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> matrices with correlated elements <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_{ji}\)</span> were built using Cholesky decomposition. Competitor networks in which off-diagonal elements <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij} \leq 0\)</span> were constructed by first building a random <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, then flipping the sign of any elements in which <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij} &gt; 0\)</span>. Similarly, mutualist networks were constructed by building a random <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, then flipping the sign of elements where <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij} &lt; 0\)</span>. Predator-prey networks were constructed by first building a random <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, then flipping the sign of either <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(A_{ji}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij} \times A_{ji} &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Small-world networks were constructed using the method of Watts and Strogatz<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Watts1998">16</a></sup></span>. First, a regular network<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Watts1998">16</a></sup></span> was created such that components were arranged in a circle. Each component was initially set to interact with its <span class="math inline">\(k/2\)</span> closest neighbouring components on each side, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> was an even natural number (e.g., for <span class="math inline">\(k = 2\)</span> the regular network forms a ring in which each component interacts with its two adjacent neighbours; see Supplemental Material for examples). Each interaction between a focal component and its neighbour was then removed and replaced with with a probability of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. In replacement, a new component was randomly selected to interact with the focal component; selection was done with equal probability among all but the focal component. The resulting small-world network was represented by a square <span class="math inline">\(S \times S\)</span> binary matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> in which 1s represented interactions between components and 0s represented the absence of an interaction. A new random matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{J}\)</span> was then generated with elements <span class="math inline">\(J_{ij}\)</span> sampled i.i.d. from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0, 0.4^{2})\)</span>. To build the interaction matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, I used element-wise multiplication <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{J} \odot \mathbf{B}\)</span>, then set <span class="math inline">\(diag(\mathbf{A}) = -1\)</span>. I set <span class="math inline">\(k = S/12\)</span> and simulated small-world networks across all combinations of <span class="math inline">\(S = \{24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta = \{0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.25, 1\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Scale-free networks were constructed using the method of Albert and Barabási<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Albert2002">17</a></sup></span>. First, a saturated network (all components interact with each other) of size <span class="math inline">\(m \leq S\)</span> was created. New components were then added sequentially to the network; each newly added component was set to interact with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> randomly selected existing components. When the system size reached <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, the distribution of the number of total interactions that components had followed a power-law tail<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Albert2002">17</a></sup></span>. The resulting network was represented by an <span class="math inline">\(S \times S\)</span> binary matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{G}\)</span>, where 1s and 0s represent the presence and absence of an interaction, respectively. As with small-world networks, a random matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{J}\)</span> was generated, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{J} \odot \mathbf{G}\)</span>. Diagonal elements were set to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. I simulated scale-free networks across all combinations of <span class="math inline">\(S = \{24, 48, 72, 96, 120\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m = \{2, 3, ..., 11, 12\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Cascade food webs were constructed following Solow and Beet<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Solow1998">18</a></sup></span>. First, a random matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> was generated with off-diagonal elements sampled i.i.d so that <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.4^{2})\)</span>. Each component in the system was ranked from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. If component <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> had a higher rank than component <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij} &lt; 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij}\)</span> was multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> had a lower rank than <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_{ji} &lt; 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(A_{ji}\)</span> was multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. In practice, this resulted in a matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> with negative and positive values in the lower and upper triangles, respectively. Diagonal elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> were set to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C = 1\)</span>. I simulated cascade food webs for <span class="math inline">\(S = \{2, 3, ..., 59, 60\}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>System feasibility</strong>. Dougoud et al.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Dougoud2018">28</a></sup></span> identify the following feasibility criteria for ecological systems characterised by <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> interacting species with varying densities in a generalised Lotka-Volterra model,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbf{n^{*}} = -\left(\theta \mathbf{I} + (CS)^{-\delta}\mathbf{J} \right)^{-1}\mathbf{r}.\]</span></p>
<p>In the above, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{n^{*}}\)</span> is the vector of species densities at equilibrium. Feasibility is satisfied if all elements in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{n^{*}}\)</span> are positive. The matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{I}\)</span> is the identity matrix, and the value <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the strength of intraspecific competition (diagonal elements). Diagonal values are set to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\theta = -1\)</span>. The variable <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is a normalisation parameter that modulates the strength of interactions (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>) for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{J}\)</span>. Implicitly, here <span class="math inline">\(\delta = 0\)</span> underlying strong interactions. Hence, <span class="math inline">\((CS)^{-\delta} = 1\)</span>, so in the above, a diagonal matrix of -1s (<span class="math inline">\(\theta \mathbf{I}\)</span>) is added to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{J}\)</span>, which has a diagonal of all zeros and an off-diagonal affecting species interactions (i.e., the expression <span class="math inline">\((CS)^{-\delta}\)</span> relates to May’s<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a></sup></span> stability criterion<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Dougoud2018">28</a></sup></span> by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\sigma}{(CS)^{-\delta}}\sqrt{SC} &lt; 1\)</span>, and hence for my purposes <span class="math inline">\((CS)^{-\delta} = 1\)</span>). Given <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A} = \theta\mathbf{I + J}\)</span>, the above criteria is therefore reduced to the below (see also Serván et al.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Servan2018">30</a></sup></span>),</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbf{n^{*} = -A^{-1}r}.\]</span></p>
<p>To check the feasibility criteria for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M = \gamma A}\)</span>, I therefore evaluated <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{-M^{-1}r}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}\)</span> elements were sampled i.i.d. from <span class="math inline">\(r \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.4^{2})\)</span>). Feasibility is satisfied if all of the elements of the resulting vector are positive.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic algorithm</strong>. Ideally, to investigate the potential of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}_{\gamma}\)</span> for increasing the proportion of stable complex systems, the search space of all possible <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> vectors would be evaluated for each unique <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M = \gamma A}\)</span>. This is technically impossible because <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> can take any real value between 0-2, but even rounding <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> to reasonable values would result in a search space too large to practically explore. Under these conditions, genetic algorithms are highly useful tools for finding practical solutions by mimicking the process of biological evolution<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Hamblin2013">31</a></sup></span>. In this case, the practical solution is finding vectors of <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> that decrease the most positive real eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span>. The genetic algorithm used achieves this by initialising a large population of 1000 different potential <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> vectors and allowing this population to evolve through a process of mutation, crossover (swaping <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> values between vectors), selection, and reproduction until either a <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> vector is found where all <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda) &lt; 0\)</span> or some “giving up” critiera is met.</p>
<p>For each <span class="math inline">\(S = \{2, 3, ..., 39, 40\}\)</span>, the genetic algorithm was run for 100000 random <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M = \gamma A}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{A} = 0.4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C = 1\)</span>). The genetic algorithm was initialised with a population of 1000 different <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> vectors with elements sampled i.i.d from <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 2)\)</span>. Eigenanalysis was performed on the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> resulting from each <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span>, and the 20 <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> vectors resulting in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> with the lowest <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda_{max})\)</span> each produced 50 clonal offspring with subsequent random mutation and crossover between the resulting new generation of 1000 <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> vectors. Mutation of each <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> in a <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> vector occurred with a probability of 0.2, resulting in a mutation effect of size <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0, 0.02^{2})\)</span> being added to generate the newly mutated <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> (any <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> values that mutated below zero were multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, and any values that mutated above 2 were set to 2). Crossover occurred between two sets of 100 <span class="math inline">\(diag(\boldsymbol{\gamma})\)</span> vectors paired in each generation; vectors were randomly sampled with replacement among but not within sets. Vector pairs selected for crossover swapped all elements between and including two <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> randomly selected with replacement (this allowed for reversal of vector element positions during crossover; e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\{\gamma_{4}, \gamma_{5}, \gamma_{6}, \gamma_{7}\} \to \{\gamma_{7}, \gamma_{6}, \gamma_{5}, \gamma_{4}\}\)</span> ). The genetic algorithm terminated if a stable <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> was found, 20 generations occurred, or if the mean <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> fitness increase between generations was less than 0.01 (where fitness was defined as <span class="math inline">\(W_{\gamma} = -\Re(\lambda_{max})\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span>).</p>
