<p><strong>The stability of a complex system generally decreases with increasing system size, as is demonstrated by random matrix theory<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>. This counter-intuitive result, first shown by May<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a></sup></span>, is broadly relevant for understanding the dynamics and persistence of systems such as ecological<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>, neurological<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Gray2008">3</a>,<a href="#ref-Gray2009">4</a></sup></span>, biochemical<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Rosenfeld2009">5</a>,<a href="#ref-MacArthur2010">6</a></sup></span> and socio-economic<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Haldane2011">7</a>–<a href="#ref-Bardoscia2017">9</a></sup></span> networks. Much attention has especially been given to the stability of ecological communities such as food webs or mutualist networks, with recent work investigating how different community structures affect stability<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Mougi2012">10</a>–<a href="#ref-Patel2018">14</a></sup></span>. But more broadly, stabilising mechanisms in complex systems remain under-developed, and the effect of variation in the response rate of individual system components remains an open problem<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2015">15</a></sup></span>. Here I show that when components of a complex system respond to system perturbation at different rates (<span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span>), the potential for system stability is markedly increased. Stability is caused by the clustering of some eigenvalues toward the centre of eigenvalue distributions despite the destabilising effect of higher interaction strength variation (<span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\sigma^{2}}\)</span>). This effect of variation in <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)</span> becomes increasingly important as system size increases, to the extent that the largest stable complex systems would otherwise be unstable if not for <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{Var(\gamma)}\)</span>. My results therefore reveal a previously unconsidered driver of system stability that is likely to be pervasive across all complex systems. Future research in complex systems should therefore account for the varying response rates of individual system components when assessing whole system stability.</strong></p>
<p>In 1972, May<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a></sup></span> first demonstrated that randomly assembled systems of sufficient complexity are almost inevitably unstable given infinitesimally small perturbations. Complexity in this case is defined by the size of the system (i.e., the number of potentially interacting components; <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>), its connectance (i.e., the probability that one component will interact with another; <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>), and the variance of interaction strengths (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}\)</span>)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>. May’s finding that the probability of local stability falls to near zero given a sufficiently high threshold of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\sqrt{SC}\)</span> has profound consequences across multiple disciplines, raising the question of how complex systems in, e.g., ecology<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Mougi2012">10</a>,<a href="#ref-Grilli2017">13</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2015">15</a></sup></span> or banking<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Haldane2011">7</a>,<a href="#ref-Bardoscia2017">9</a>,<a href="#ref-May2008">16</a></sup></span> are predicted to persist or change.</p>
<p>Randomly assembled complex systems can be represented as large square matrices (<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>) with <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> components (e.g., species<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span> or banks<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Haldane2011">7</a></sup></span>). One element of such a matrix, <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span>, defines how component <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> affects component <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the system at a point of equilibrium<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>. Off-diagonal elements (<span class="math inline">\(i \neq j\)</span>) therefore define interactions between components, while diagonal elements (<span class="math inline">\(i = j\)</span>) define component self-regulation (e.g., carrying capacity in ecological communities). Traditionally, off-diagonal elements are assigned non-zero values with a probability <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, which are sampled from a distribution with variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}\)</span>; diagonal elements are set to -1<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2015">15</a></sup></span>. Local system stability is assessed using eigenanalysis, with the system being stable if the real parts of all eigenvalues (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> are negative (<span class="math inline">\(\max\left(\Re(\lambda)\right) &lt; 0\)</span>)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>. In a large system (high <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>), eigenvalues are distributed uniformly<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Tao2010">17</a></sup></span> within a circle centred at <span class="math inline">\(\Re = -1\)</span> (the mean value of diagonal elements) and <span class="math inline">\(\Im = 0\)</span>, with a radius of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\sqrt{SC}\)</span><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2015">15</a></sup></span> (Figs 1a and 2a). Local stability of randomly assembled systems therefore becomes increasingly unlikely as <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{2}\)</span> increase.</p>
<p>The above stability criterion assumes that individual components respond to perturbations of the system at the same rate (<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>), but this is highly unlikely in any complex system. In ecological communities, for example, the rate at which population density changes following perturbation will depend on the generation time of individuals, which might vary by orders of magnitude among species. Species with short generation times will respond quickly (high <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>) to perturbations relative to species with long generation times (low <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>). Similarly, the speed at which individual banks respond to perturbations in financial networks, or individuals or institutions respond to perturbations in complex social networks, is likely to vary. The effect of such variance has not been investigated in complex systems theory. Intuitively, variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> might be expected to decrease system stability by introducing a new source of variation into the system and thereby increasing <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Here I show why, despite higher <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, complex systems in which <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> varies are actually more likely to be stable, especially when <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is high.</p>

In 1 million randomly generated complex systems under the same parameter values, 1 was stable when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> while 32 were stable when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = \{1.95, 0.05\}\)</span>. Overall, complex systems that are separated into fast versus slow components tend to be more stable than otherwise identical systems with identical component response rates.</p>

<p>Rows in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> define how a given component <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is affected by other components of the system, meaning that the rate of component response time can be modelled by multiplying all row elements by a real scalar value <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Patel2018">14</a></sup></span> (see Supplementary Information for details). The distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> components thereby models the distribution of component response rates. An instructive example compares one <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i} = 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to the same <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> when half of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i} = 1.95\)</span> and half of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i} = 0.05\)</span>. This models one system in which <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is invariant and one in which <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> varies, but systems are otherwise identical (note <span class="math inline">\(E[\gamma_{i}] = 1\)</span> in both cases). I assume <span class="math inline">\(S = 200\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C = 0.05\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 0.4\)</span>; diagonal elements are set to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and non-zero off-diagonal elements are drawn randomly from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2})\)</span>. Rows are then multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> to generate <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i} = 1\)</span>, eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> are distributed uniformly within a circle centred at (<span class="math inline">\(-1, 0\)</span>) with a radius of 1.265 (Fig. 1a). Hence, the real components of eigenvalues are highly unlikely to all be negative when all <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i} = 1\)</span>. But when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> values are separated into two groups, eigenvalues are no longer uniformly distributed (Fig. 1b). Instead, two distinct clusters of eigenvalues appear (grey circles in Fig. 1b), one centred at (<span class="math inline">\(-1.95, 0\)</span>) and the other centred at (<span class="math inline">\(-0.05, 0\)</span>). The former has a large radius, but the real components have shifted to the left (in comparison to when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span>) and all <span class="math inline">\(\Re({\lambda}) &lt; 0\)</span>. The latter cluster has real components that have shifted to the right, but has a smaller radius. Overall, for 1 million randomly assembled <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, this division between slow and fast component response rates results in more stable systems: 1 stable given <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> versus 32 stable given <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = \{1.95, 0.5\}\)</span>.</p>

Black and red elipses in both panels show the circle centred on the distribution in panels a and b, respectively, which have a radius of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \sqrt{SC}\)</span>.

<hr>
<p>Higher stability in systems with variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> can be observed by sampling <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> values from various distributions. I now focus on a uniform distribution where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 2)\)</span> (see Supplementary Information for other distributions, which give similar results). As with the case of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = \{1.95, 0.5\}\)</span> (Fig. 1b), <span class="math inline">\(E[\gamma] = 1\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 2)\)</span>, allowing comparison of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> before and after variation in component response rate. Figure 2 shows a comparison of eigenvalue distributions given <span class="math inline">\(S = 1000\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C = 1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 0.4\)</span>. As expected<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Tao2010">17</a></sup></span>, when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span>, eigenvalues are distributed uniformly in a circle centred at (<span class="math inline">\(-1, 0\)</span>) with a radius of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\sqrt{SC} =\)</span> 12.649. Uniform variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> leads to a non-uniform distribution of eigenvalues, some of which are clustered tightly around the centre of the distribution, but others of which are spread outside the former radius of 12.649 (red circle Fig 2b). This larger radius occurs because the addition of <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> increases the realised <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The clustering and spreading of eigenvalues introduced by <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> can destabilise previously stable systems or stabilise systems that are otherwise unstable. But where systems are otherwise too complex to be stable given <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span>, the effect of <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> can often lead to stability above May’s<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-May1972">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span> threshold of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\sqrt{SC} &gt; 1\)</span>.</p>

For each <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, 1 million complex systems are randomly generated. Stability of each complex system is tested given variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> by randomly sampling <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 2)\)</span>. Stability given <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> is then compared to stability in an otherwise identical system in which <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = E[\mathcal{U}(0, 2)]\)</span> for all components. Light and dark grey bars show the number of stable systems in the absence and presence of <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span>, respectively. The black line shows the proportion of systems that are stable when <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma) &gt; 0\)</span>, but would be unstable if <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="RandomMatrixStability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="864"></p>
<hr>
<p>To investigate the effect of <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> on system stability, I simulated random <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> matrices at <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 0.4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C = 1\)</span> across <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> ranging from 2-32. One million <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> were simulated for each <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and the stability of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> was assessed given <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 2)\)</span>. I found that the number of stable random systems was consistently higher given <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> than when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> (Fig. 3), and that the difference between the probabilities of observing a stable system increased with an increase in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>; i.e., the potential for <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> to drive stability increased with system complexity. For the highest values of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, nearly all systems that were stable given <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> would not have been stable given <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> (see Supplementary Information for full results). This suggests that the stability of large systems might be dependent upon variation in the response rate of their individual components, meaning that factors such as generation time (in ecological networks), transaction speed (in economic networks), or communication speed (in social networks) needs to be considered when investigating the stability of complex systems.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> is not stabilising per se; that is, adding variation in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> to a particular system <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> does not necessarily increase the probability that the system will be stable (see Supplementary Information). Rather, systems that are observed to be stable are more likely to vary in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, and for this <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> to be critical to their stability. This is caused by the shift in the distribution of eigenvalues that occurs by introducing <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> (Fig. 1b, 2b), which can sometimes result in all <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda) &lt; 0\)</span> but might also increase <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\lambda)\)</span> values.</p>
<p>To further investigate the potential of <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> to be stabilising, I used a genetic algorithm (the space of possible <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> values was too large to search exhaustively<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Hamblin2013">18</a></sup></span>; see Supplementary Information). For each of 10000 random <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the genetic algorithm initialised 1000 different sets of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 2)\)</span> values of size <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Eigenanalysis was performed on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> using each set of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> values, and the 20 sets with the lowest <span class="math inline">\(\max\left(\Re(\lambda)\right)\)</span> each produced 50 clonal offspring with subsequent mutation and crossover between the resulting new population of 1000 <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> sets. The genetic algorithm terminated if a stable <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> was found, 20 generations occurred, or a convergence criteria of minimum fitness increase between generations was satisfied. Across <span class="math inline">\(S = \{2, 3, ..., 39, 40\}\)</span>, sets of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> values were found that resulted in stable systems with probabilities that were orders of magnitude higher than when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> (see Supplementary Information), meaning that stability could often be achieved by manipulating <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> values rather than <span class="math inline">\(S \times S\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> elements. Hence, managing the response rates of system components in a targetted way can potentially facilitate the stabilisation of complex systems through a reduction in dimensionality.</p>
<p>I have focused broadly on random complex systems, but it is also worthwhile to consider more restricted interactions such as those of specific ecological networks<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2012">2</a></sup></span>. These include systems in which all interactions are negative (competitive networks), positive (mutualist networks), or <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> pairs have opposing signs (predator-prey networks). In general, competitive and mutualist networks tend to be destabilising, and predator-prey network tend to be stabilising<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Allesina2011">19</a></sup></span>. When <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span> is applied to each, the proportion of stable competitive and predator-prey networks increases, but the proportion of stable mutualist networks does not (see Supplementary Information). Additionally, when each component of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is interpreted as a unique species and given a random intrinsic growth rate<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-Dougoud2018">20</a></sup></span>, feasibility is not increased by <span class="math inline">\(Var(\gamma)\)</span>, suggesting that variation in species generation time might be unlikely to drive stability in purely multi-species networks (see Supplementary Information).</p>
<p>My results show that complex systems are more likely to be stable when the response rates of system components vary. These results are broadly applicable to complex biological and social networks.</p>
